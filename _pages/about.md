**Currently:** Spring 2022 Intern @ Terkel

**Formerly:** Tech Incubator @ Capital One

Student at UIUC. üåΩ

Some cool things I've done:
<a href=""></a>
1. Created Snapchat <a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/creator/1qj0sSa8xjg1C94UkUmBXA">lenses</a> with 150+ million views (try them yourself!)
2. Went viral (in the Champaign-Urbana area) for  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHLSrK-BY2s">this</a>
3. Got the blue checkmark on Spotify with sub-SoundCloud level talent

Some cool things I'm doing:
1. Coding to make my <a href="projects/" target="_blank">shower thoughts</a> a reality
2. Growing a monetized TikTok brand (27k and counting) for my NBA2K character
3. Leading the Content Team (web design, photo & video, merchandise) for <a href="https://instagram.com/uiuc_imbc">IMBC</a>

**I love throwing myself into the deep end, learning new things, and meeting new people.**

In the past, this has led me to compete in triathalons, <a href="https://msports.org">luge</a>, fly a turboprop aircraft (with a supervisor), and learn NLP with no prior machine learning experience.

In the future, it means that I can be a great asset to you or your company.

I always keep my email at inbox zero. Reach out and I bet I'll get back to you within 12 hours. ‚¨áÔ∏è
